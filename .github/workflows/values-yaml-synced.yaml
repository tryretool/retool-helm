# Our top level values.yaml is what customers start with in new deployments,
# but helm needs it to live at chart/retool/values.yaml. Eventually we should
# shrink our values.yaml to only the required values and point customers at
# chart/retool/values.yaml as the reference for all configurable values. Until
# then, we have both copies and should make sure they don't diverge.
